=== BINLOG IMPORT RESULT ===
Date: February 2, 2026

IMPORT STATUS: PARTIALLY UNSUCCESSFUL

WHAT HAPPENED:
The binlog files use Row-Based Replication (RBR) format, which stores binary
representations of data changes, not actual SQL statements. These cannot be
directly imported using mysql < file.sql.

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
- Binlog format: Row-Based Replication (RBR)
- Import method tried: Direct SQL import
- Result: No errors, but no data restored
- Current leads count: 27 (unchanged from pre-import)

WHY THIS HAPPENED:
Row-based binlogs are designed for MySQL replication (master-slave), not for
direct recovery. They contain binary row images that need special handling.

CURRENT DATABASE STATE:
- Tables: All present with correct structure
- Data: Only 27 leads from October 2025 (seed/test data)
- Missing: All January 2026 transactional data

WHAT WAS RECOVERED:
✓ 71 MB of binlog data extracted (Jan 2-31, 2026)
✓ 212,574 transactions captured
✓ Files created but cannot be directly imported

RECOVERY OPTIONS:
1. MySQL Dump Backup: Check for .sql backup files created with mysqldump
2. File System Backup: Check if you have file-level backups
3. Cloud Backup: Check if you have automated cloud database backups
4. Snapshot: Check if your VPS provider has VM snapshots

TO SEARCH FOR BACKUPS:
# Check common backup locations
ls -lh /var/backups/*.sql* 2>/dev/null
ls -lh /root/backups/*.sql* 2>/dev/null  
ls -lh /backup/*.sql* 2>/dev/null
ls -lh ~/backups/*.sql* 2>/dev/null

# Check for compressed backups
find / -name "*taurus*.sql.gz" -o -name "*taurus*.sql.bz2" 2>/dev/null

RECOMMENDATION:
The binlog recovery approach cannot restore your data directly. You need to
find a mysqldump backup file or restore from a system-level backup if available.

If no backups exist, the data from January 2026 may be unrecoverable.
